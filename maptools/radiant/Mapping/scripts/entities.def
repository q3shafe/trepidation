-------- KEYS --------
"target" : the name of the entity targetted at for projection
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
(none)
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies a decal to be projected. Should contain 1 or more patch meshes (curves) and target an info_null entity. The distance between the center of the _decal entity and the target is the axis and distance of projection.

/*QUAKED _skybox (0.77 0.88 1.0) (-4 -4 -4) (4 4 4)
-------- KEYS --------
"angle" : rotation angle of the sky surfaces.
"angles" : Individual control of PITCH, YAW, and ROLL (default 0 0 0).
"_scale" : scaling factor (default 64), good values are between 50 and 300, depending on the map.
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
(none)
-------- NOTES --------
Compiler-only entity that specifies a the origin of a skybox (a wholly contained, seperate area of the map), similar to some games' portal skies. When compiled with Q3Map2, the skybox surfaces will be visible from any place where sky is normally visible. It will cast shadows on the normal parts of the map, and can be used with cloud layers and other effects.

BFG ammo. Gives the player 15 by default.
-------- KEYS --------
wait : time in seconds before item respawns after being picked up (default 40, -1 = never respawn).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).
count: sets the amount of ammo given to the player when picked up (default 15).
team : set this to team items. Teamed items will respawn randomly after team master is picked up (see Notes).
target : picking up the item will trigger the entity this points to.
targetname : a target_give entity can point to this for respawn freebies.
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
notbot : used to make an item invisible for bot attraction. 
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
SUSPENDED : item will spawn where it was placed in map and won't drop to the floor.

The amount of time it takes for an item in the team to respawn is determined by the "wait" value of the item that was picked up previously. So if one of the items in the team has it's "wait" key set to -1 (never respawn), the random respawning cycle of the teamed items will stop after that item is picked up.

When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).

alphamap : this is the path/name for the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.
layers : this integer value is the number unique root shaders that will be use on the terrain.
shader : this is the path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity.

/*QUAKED func_pendulum (0 .5 .8) ?
Solid entity that describes a pendulum back and forth rotation movement. Rotates on the X axis by default. Pendulum frequency is a physical constant based on the length of the beam and gravity. Blocking the pendulum instantly kills a player.
-------- KEYS --------
angle : angle offset of axis of rotation from default X axis (default 0).
speed : angle of swing arc in either direction from initial position (default 30).
phase : sets the start offset of the swinging cycle. Values must be 0 < phase < 1. Any integer phase value is the same as no offset (default 0).
noise : path/name of .wav file to play. Use looping sounds only (eg. sound/world/drone6.wav).
model2 : path/name of model to include (eg: models/mapobjects/jets/jets01.md3).
origin : alternate method of setting XYZ origin of entity's rotation axis and .md3 model included with entity (default "0 0 0" - See Notes).

-------- NOTES --------
You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity. The center of that brush will be the point through which the rotation axis passes. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. Pendulum will rotate along the X axis by default. Very crude operation: pendulum cannot rotate along Z axis, the speed of swing (frequency) is not adjustable. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

/*QUAKED func_plat (0 .5 .8) ?
Rising platform the player can ride to reach higher places. Plats must always be drawn in the raised position, so they will operate and be lighted correctly but they spawn in the lowered position. The plat will stay in the raised position until the player steps off. There are no proper sounds for this entity, only beep noises. It will spawn in the game and work properly but it sounds silly (see Notes).
-------- KEYS --------
speed : determines how fast the plat moves (default 150).
lip : lip remaining at end of move (default 16). Has no effect if "height" is set.
height : if set, this will determine the total amount of vertical travel of the plat.
dmg : damage to inflict on player when he blocks operation of plat (default 4). Plat will reverse direction when blocked.
targetname : if set, the trigger that points to this will raise the plat each time it fires. The plat raises and comes back down a second later if no player is on it.
light : constantLight radius of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 0).
color : constantLight color of .md3 model included with entity. Has no effect on the entity's brushes (default 1 1 1).

_layers OR layers : Integer value is the number unique root shaders that will be use on the terrain.
_shader OR shader : Path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.
-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the "height" key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the "lip" key. Using the "height" key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

There is a way to make plats play proper sounds. Just create a sound\movers\plats folder under baseq3 and put 2 sounds named pt1_strt.wav and pt1_end.wav in it. Those can be the renamed sounds from the Q2 plats or renamed copies of the sound\movers\doors sounds you can extract from your pak0.pk3 file or new custom sounds if you're up to it. Thanks to Fragzilla for the tip.

/*QUAKED misc_portal_camera (1 .5 .25) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8) SLOWROTATE FASTROTATE
Portal camera. This camera is used to project its view onto a portal surface in the level through the intermediary of a misc_portal_surface entity. Use the "angles" key or target a target_position or info_notnull entity to set the camera's pointing direction.
-------- KEYS --------
angles: this sets the pitch and yaw aiming angles of the portal camera (default 0 0). Use "roll" key to set roll angle.
target : point this to a target_position entity to set the camera's pointing direction.
targetname : a misc_portal_surface portal surface indicator must point to this.
roll: roll angle of camera. A value of 0 is upside down and 180 is the same as the player's view.
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
SLOWROTATE : makes the portal camera rotate slowly along the roll axis.
FASTROTATE : makes the portal camera rotate faster along the roll axis.
-------- NOTES --------
Both the setting "angles" key or "targeting a target_position" methods can be used to aim the camera. However, the target_position method is simpler. In both cases, the "roll" key must be used to set the roll angle. If either the SLOWROTATE or FASTROTATE spawnflag is set, then the "roll" value is irrelevant.*/

Sound generating entity that plays .wav files. Normal non-looping sounds play each time the target_speaker is triggered. Looping sounds can be set to play by themselves (no activating trigger) or be toggled on/off by a trigger.
-------- KEYS --------
noise : path/name of .wav file to play (eg. sound/world/growl1.wav - see Notes).
wait : delay in seconds between each time the sound is played ("random" key must be set - see Notes).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay ("wait" key must be set - see Notes).

-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
LOOPED_ON : sound will loop and initially start on in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
LOOPED_OFF : sound will loop and initially start off in level (will toggle on/off when triggered).
GLOBAL : sound will play full volume throughout the level.
ACTIVATOR : sound will play only for the player that activated the target.
-------- NOTES --------
The path portion value of the "noise" key can be replaced by the implicit folder character "*" for triggered sounds that belong to a particular player model. For example, if you want to create a "bottomless pit" in which the player screams and dies when he falls into, you would place a trigger_multiple over the floor of the pit and target a target_speaker with it. Then, you would set the "noise" key to "*falling1.wav". The * character means the current player model's sound folder. So if your current player model is Visor, * = sound/player/visor, if your current player model is Sarge, * = sound/player/sarge, etc. This cool feature provides an excellent way to create "player-specific" triggered sounds in your levels.

The combination of the "wait" and "random" keys can be used to play non-looping sounds without requiring an activating trigger but both keys must be used together. The value of the "random" key is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).*/

/*QUAKED trigger_always (.5 .5 .5) (-8 -8 -8) (8 8 8)
Automatic trigger. It will fire the entities it targets as soon as it spawns in the game.
-------- KEYS --------
target : this points to the entity to activate.
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).*/

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED trigger_hurt (.5 .5 .5) ? START_OFF - SILENT NO_PROTECTION SLOW
Any player that touches this will be hurt by "dmg" points of damage once per server frame (very fast). A sizzling sound is also played while the player is being hurt.
-------- KEYS --------
dmg : number of points of damage inflicted to player per server frame (default 5 - integer values only).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
START_OFF needs to be triggered (toggle) for damage
SILENT : supresses the sizzling sound while player is being hurt.
NO_PROTECTION : player will be hurt regardless of protection (see Notes).
SLOW : changes the damage rate to once per second.
-------- NOTES --------
The invulnerability power-up (item_enviro) does not protect the player from damage caused by this entity regardless of whether the NO_PROTECTION spawnflag is set or not. Triggering a trigger_hurt will have no effect if the START_OFF spawnflag is not set. A trigger_hurt always starts on in the game.*/

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED trigger_multiple (.5 .5 .5) ?
Variable size repeatable trigger. It will fire the entities it targets when touched by player. Can be made to operate like a trigger_once entity by setting the "wait" key to -1. It can also be activated by another trigger that targets it.
-------- KEYS --------
target : this points to the entity to activate.
targetname : activating trigger points to this.
wait : time in seconds until trigger becomes re-triggerable after it's been touched (default 0.2, -1 = trigger once).
random : random time variance in seconds added or subtracted from "wait" delay (default 0 - see Notes).
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
When the random key is set, its value is used to calculate a minimum and a maximum delay. The final time delay will be a random value anywhere between the minimum and maximum values: (min delay = wait - random) (max delay = wait + random).*/

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED trigger_push (.5 .5 .5) ?
This is used to create jump pads and launch ramps. It MUST point to a target_position or info_notnull entity to work. Unlike target_push, this is client side predicted.
-------- KEYS --------
target : this points to the target_position to which the player will jump.
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.
notteam : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Teamplay" and "CTF" modes.
notsingle : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in Single Player mode (bot play mode).
-------- NOTES --------
To make a jump pad or launch ramp, place the target_position/info_notnull entity at the highest point of the jump and target it with this entity.*/

//=============================================================================

/*QUAKED trigger_teleport (.5 .5 .5) ?
Touching this will teleport players to the location of the targeted misc_teleporter_dest entity. This entity allows client prediction of events.
-------- KEYS --------
target : this must point to a misc_teleporter_dest entity.
notfree : when set to 1, entity will not spawn in "Free for all" and "Tournament" modes.

/*QUAKED worldspawn (0 0 0) ?
Only used for the world.
-------- KEYS --------
message : text to print at user logon. Used for name of level.
music : path/name of looping .wav file used for level's music (eg. music/sonic5.wav).
_ambient OR ambient : Adds a constant value to overall lighting. Use is not recommended. Ambient light will have a tendency to flatten out variations in light and shade.
_color : RGB value for ambient light color (default is 0 0 0).
gravity : gravity of level (default is normal gravity: 800).
gridsize : granularity of the lightgrid created by q3map. Value is three integers separated by spaces, representing number of units between grid points in X Y Z. Default gridsize value is 128 128 256. Use larger powers of 2 to reduce BSP size and compile time on very large maps.
_blocksize : q3map always splits the BSP tree along the planes X=_blocksize*n and Y=_blocksize*n. Default _blocksize value is 1024. Increase the blocksize using larger powers of 2 to reduce compile times on very large maps with a low structural brush density.
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
_minlight : Minimum light value, levelwide. Uses the _color key to set color. Does not add unlike ambient.
_minvertexlight : Minimum vertex lighting, levelwide.
_mingridlight : Minimum lightgrid (dynamic entity lighting) levelwide.
_keeplights : Keep light entities in the BSP. Normally stripped out by the BSP process and read from the .map file by the lighting phase.
_noshadersun : Ignore q3map_sun/sun directives in sky shaders and ONLY use entity sun lights.
_farplanedist : Limit on how many units the vis phase of compilation can see. Used in combination with level-wide fog, it can help reduce r_speeds on large, open maps.
_foghull : Shader to use for "fog hull." Foghull shader should be a sky shader. Omit the "textures/" prefix.
_lightmapscale : Floating point value scaling the resolution of lightmaps on brushes/patches in the world. Can be overridden in func_group (or other entities) (default 1.0).
_cs OR _castshadows : Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. > 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.
_rs OR _receiveshadows : Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. > 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. < 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.
_celshader : Sets the cel shader used for this geometry. Note: omit the "textures/" prefix. Overridable in entities.
-------- Q3MAP2 TERRAIN KEYS --------
_indexmap OR alphamap : Path/name for the art file used to guide the mapping of textures on the terrain surface.
_layers OR layers : Integer value is the number unique root shaders that will be use on the terrain.
_shader OR shader : Path to the metashader used to assign textures to the terrain entity. Note: Omit the "textures/" prefix.*/
