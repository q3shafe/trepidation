=====================
Compiling From Source
===================== 
Trepidation's source code is available via our Sourceforge Subversion Repository. 
http://svn.sourceforge.net/trepidation

This project's SourceForge.net Subversion repository can be checked out through SVN with the following instruction set:

svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/trepidation trepidation

(Warning: This is a generic Subversion checkout command which will pull all modules, tags and/or branches of the project. Please use "Browse Repository" link; in most cases, you will want to add '/trunk' to the HTTPS URL above to check out only trunk (main development line)).

Updates from within the module's directory do not need the URL string.

NOTE: UNIX file and directory names are case sensitive.

=============
Prerequisites
=============

- SDL is required (everywhere but Windows), Linux users need development packages if they want to compile the game. You can optionally disable SDL in the Makefile but this configuration is currently untested.

- OpenAL is optionally disable-able. Apple Mac OS X 10.4 comes with OpenAL.

- Subversion is used for acquiring our modified version of the id source code. If you're using a binary package, then you won't need this.

- Apple Mac OS X users need X Code installed for gcc, and subversion and other interesting things.

- LibMAD: is used for MP3 support (as of 07-01-07).

- Ogg/Vorbis is the preferred sound format in Trepidation (as of 07-01-07)

This part assumes Windows users are using Cygwin. If you aren't, TortoiseSVN is a good client.
Change into a directory that you want the tree to be kept in.

Check out the source tree:

svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/trepidation trepidation
(You can check out a specific revision with the -r option, like this: svn svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/trepidation trepidation -r100) 
Read the README file. Really. Do it.

=====================
Compile and install: 
====================

For *nix
  1. Change to the directory containing this readme.
  2. Run 'make'.

For Windows, using MinGW
  1. Download and install MinGW and MSys from http://www.mingw.org/.
  2. Download http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/common/directx-devel.tar.gz
     and untar it into your MinGW directory (usually C:\MinGW).
  3. Open an MSys terminal, and follow the instructions for compiling on *nix.

For Windows, using MSVC
  1. Run Visual Studio and open the quake3.sln file in the code/win32/msvc
     directory.
  2. Build.
  3. Copy the resultant Quake3.exe to your quake 3 directory, make a backup if
     you want to keep your original. If you wish to use native libraries, copy
     the resultant dlls to your baseq3 directory.

For Mac OS X, building a Universal Binary
  1. Install the MacOSX10.2.8.sdk and MacOSX10.4u.sdk which are included in
     XCode 2.2 and newer.
  2. Change to the directory containing this README file.
  3. Run './make-macosx-ub.sh'
  4. Copy the resulting ioquake3.app in /build/release-darwin-ub to your 
     /Applications/ioquake3 folder.

Installation, for *nix
  1. Set the COPYDIR variable in the shell to be where you installed Quake 3
     to.  By default it will be /usr/local/games/quake3 if you haven't set it.
     This is the path as used by the original Linux Q3 installer and subsequent
     point releases.
  2. Run 'make copyfiles'.

It is also possible to cross compile for Windows under *nix using MinGW. A
script is available to build a cross compilation environment from
http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/cross/build-cross.sh. The gcc/binutils
version numbers that the script downloads may need to be altered. After you
have successfully run this script cross compiling is simply a case of using
'./cross-make-mingw.sh' in place of 'make'.

If the make based build system is being used (i.e. *nix or MinGW), the
following variables may be set, either on the command line or in
Makefile.local:

  OPTIMIZE          - use this for custom CFLAGS
  DEFAULT_BASEDIR   - extra path to search for baseq3 and such
  BUILD_SERVER      - build the 'ioq3ded' server binary
  BUILD_CLIENT      - build the 'ioquake3' client binary
  BUILD_CLIENT_SMP  - build the 'ioquake3-smp' client binary
  BUILD_GAME_SO     - build the game shared libraries
  BUILD_GAME_QVM    - build the game qvms
  USE_SDL           - use the SDL backend where available
  USE_OPENAL        - use OpenAL where available
  USE_OPENAL_DLOPEN - link with OpenAL at runtime
  USE_CURL          - use libcurl for http/ftp download support
  USE_CURL_DLOPEN   - link with libcurl at runtime
  USE_CODEC_VORBIS  - enable Ogg Vorbis support
  USE_CODEC_MP3     - enable MP3 support. Requires libmad to be installed.
  USE_LOCAL_HEADERS - use headers local to ioq3 instead of system ones
  USE_CCACHE        - use ccache compiler caching tool
  COPYDIR           - the target installation directory

The defaults for these variables differ depending on the target platform.
