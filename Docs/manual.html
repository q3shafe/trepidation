<P>Trepidation: It's hard to be human.</P>
<P>In a not so far future, evolution will take it's course and being human is going to be very hard...</P>
<P>Life always find it's way. Mutation occurs, nature tries, nature fails. But sometimes, somehow, the lottery is won and two poor mutated freaks are able to breed...</P>
<P>Around 2550 (?) the old human race is facing two new races: The Fair (homo sapien superior) and the Ogre (homo sapien truculentus).</P>
<P>Fair are the winner of intelligence. Tall, light weight, pale skin, pointy eyes pointy ears and a very big brain. Not as tough as human, they are quicker and make formidable opponent in combat. 4% of the Fair have telepathic abilities. They have<BR>mastered technology, their culture is now the most advance both military and socially.</P>
<P>The Ogre are tough, they are champion of adaptation. They are unstoppable living machine, resistant to any toxic compound, even radiation. Physic: they are a big pile of ugly muscles, and despite their 'animal' side, they have manage to build a<BR>great society able to challenge both Human and Fair. 8% of the Ogre are horned. That give them a special status in their tribe.</P>
<P>Now the 3 races have to share the earth. Hostile the each other, incapable of coexistence, they are in a constant war, fighting for the remaining resources of the planet.</P>
<P>Life in that time is a non-stop trepidation...</P>
<P>Races:</P>
<P>Human (homo sapien sapien)<BR>Fair (homo sapien superior)<BR>Ogre (homo sapien truculentus)<BR>Construct (cyborg, droid...)</P>

<P><STRONG>M42 GAUSS RIFLE</STRONG> (Weapon 7)<BR>A coilgun (also known as Gauss gun or Gauss rifle) is a type of cannon that uses a series of electromagnets to accelerate a magnetic shell to very high velocities. Coilguns are often mistakenly called railguns by many sources, and while they are similar in general concept (that is, a magnetic gun), they differ in operation, as a railgun accelerates projectiles down two parallel conducting rails. Coilguns are essentially, identical to mass drivers, though on a smaller scale. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_gun )<BR><STRONG>Primary fire</STRONG> is a very focused shot.<BR>

<P>Alternate fire fires a particle displacement grenade (PDG). This weapon fires a projectile. From the time you fire the projectile you have 30 seconds to obtain a lock and use it. A lock is only obtained once the projectile lands and comes to a complete stop. Once a lock is obtained you can then press the PDG key and you transport to the location of the projectile location. The projectile expires when you fire another or after 30 seconds. The 30 seconds begins from the time you fire the projectile. The keybinding is in OPTIONS->CONTROLS->MISC. Be careful though.. If you transport into a wall you may be stuck.</P>

<P><STRONG>DEVASTATOR (Weapon 9)</STRONG><BR>The devestator is the most powerful weapon available in Trepidation. The devastator fires high energy plasma projectiles. The power behind this weapon causes the projectiles to be very heavy and delivers a huge explosion.</P>
<P>The Devastator primary attack fires a very powerful, SLOW moving burst, the projectile is affected a bit by gravity. Direct hits are deadly and splash damage is fairly large.<BR><BR>The Devastator Secondary attack is similar to primary fire except the projectile is a lot larger and it will explode twice after a few seconds into a total of 6 projectiles which will cause significant damage to the entire area. It's good to be far away from the area when this happens. The reload time for alt fire is about 3 1/2 seconds. With the Devastator's secondary fire, it's best to aim high and get out of dodge. The Devastator is not practical in enclosed spaces, as anyone within the range of its large explosion will take damage regardless of their amounts of armor and health... <BR><BR><BR>Each time... </P>

<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>DEATHMATCH/FREE FOR ALL</FONT></STRONG> (g_gametype 0) <BR>As the title implies this is every person for themselves. The goal of a deathmatch game is to kill (or "frag") as many other players as possible until a certain condition or limit is reached, commonly being a fraglimit or timelimit. Once one of these conditions is met, the match is over, and the winner is whoever has accumulated the most frags.

You can follow the players by using &#8220;team follow1&#8221;, &#8220;team follow2&#8221;, and you can be a scoreboard by using &#8220;team scoreboard&#8221;. <BR><BR><STRONG><FONT size=4>CAPTURE THE FLAG</FONT></STRONG><BR>Capture The Flag (CTF) is a traditional game where two teams each have a flag and the objective is to capture the other team's flag, located at the team's "base", and bring it back to their own base.<BR><BR><STRONG><FONT size=4>INSTAGIB.</FONT><BR></STRONG>Instagib can be played in most gametypes. In instagib all players carry only a M42Gauss Rifle, which has infinite ammunition and fires instantly lethal shots with infinite velocity, at a low rate of fire. Since everyone always has the same weapon and there are no health, ammo or other pickups to collect, gameplay tends to have a heavy emphasis on reflexes, hand-eye coordination and positioning, as opposed to resource management and control. Because every single shot can instantly explode an enemy from any range, gameplay also tends to be very fast paced.</P>
<P><STRONG><FONT size=4>ARSENAL</FONT> </STRONG>(g_gamemode 2) <BR>In Arsenal, You start out with an Arsenal of weapons pre-determined by the server admin. unlimited ammo and If you die your weapon is dropped (free for anyone to salvage) and you dont get it back.<BR><BR>The Object, is not to let your arsenal empty out.

When there are only 2 people left Showdown starts, the last stage of the game becomes increasingly difficult as you'll find that powerups, armor and health become more and more scarce.. </P>
<P>If you pickup a weapon that isnt in your arsenal, you can use it until you die, but it doesnt get placed into your arsenal.</P>
<P>Game Tips: pickup every weapon you see, if it's a weapon you dont have be sure to use it, because if you get killed with it you wont lose a weapon out of your arsenal, as it will give you a longer run.<BR><BR><STRONG><FONT size=4>SURVIVAL</FONT> </STRONG>(g_gamemode 2) <BR>Last Man Standing is typically played in with g_gametype set to 0/Deathmatch, however LMS can be played in Team Deathmatch as well. In LMS each player is randomly given a single weapon with unlimited ammo from the pool of weapons <BR>available (specified by the server admin). The object of Last Man Standing is exactly as the name implies. Be the last person standing. Do not get killed (even once!) as you will be eliminated for the remainder of the round. <BR><BR>

  <strong><font size="4">TREPIDATION </font></strong>(g_gamemode 3)<br />
A Team based game where the object is to destroy the other team's Power Core to make a point for your team. Various defensive structures can be built to protect your base and achieve your goal. While this game employs strategy it is extremely fast paced and teamwork is a must. </P>
<p>Classes: Not yet defined, but will be based on the races in the storyline.</p>
<p>Both teams are givin 35 seconds to build a power core at the start of each round or after each score. If the team fails to build one, one will be built automatically in a random spot on the map (most likely in a spot difficult to defend).</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <p align="left"><strong><em>Power Core:<br />
    </em></strong>The power core must be destroyed by weapons fire or other such explosives. Destroying the power core will require multiple hits. When a sheild generator is present the power core becomes shielded and will regenerate. 2 shield generators will offer more protection and cause the power core to regenerate to a faster and to a higher level of health. A sheilded power core can be taken out without taking out the shield generators however it will take a significant amount of firepower, also so long as the shield generator(s) are operational, the power core's shield and health will regenerate. Once it has sustained enough fire to take out the shield the shield will not re-activate and regeneration stops, regardless if a shield generator is present.<br />

      </em></strong>Immobilizers are defensive devices that emit an immobilization field that causes foes to lose the ability to move.  While it is possible to break free from an immobilizer field it can prove difficult.  Immobilizers are best used in conjunction with turrets, as the immobiler will render the enemy immobile, the turret will finish the job.   Immobilizers can be destroyed quite easily and work best when well concealed, unfortunately immobilizers are line of site devices, which means a clear path needs to be established between the enemy and the immobilizer.<br />

  <p><strong><em>Turrets<br />
  </em></strong>A limited number of turrets can be created to help protect your MC and sheild generators. Turrets will seek and fire upon any enemy within the turret's range. There are 3 types of turrets available throughout the game, better turrets become available as the game progresses. The 3 different types are:</p>
  <blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <p><em><strong>Basic Turret:</strong><br />
    </em>Basic turrets will fire machine gun fire at a target. Basic turrets are the primary turret available at the start of the game. Basic can be shot down fairly easily and cause very little damage.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Shielded Turret:<br />
    </strong></em>Shielded turrets are tougher than the basic turret, the turret's health regenerates and the turret itself is protected by a sheild. Eventually with enough damage the shield will drop and the turret's health will cease to regenerate. Damage caused by this turret is significantly greater than the basic turret.</p>
    <p><em><strong>Cloaked Turrets:</strong><br />
      </em>Cloaked turrets are the most powerful turret in the game. These turrets remain invisible and only appear when a target is in range. <br />

<P>While there is a planned EF Compatability layer so that EF Maps will run on it as well as Quake 3 maps it has yet to be implemented. For the best luck as far as mapping for Trepidation is to use GtkRadiant or Q3Radiant, Since the game will eventually run any EF map and any Q3 map.. EF Radiant, GtkRadiant or Q3Radiant will suffice... At the moment only q3 maps will spawn weapons/ammo/etc.. (so Q3Radiant might be better in the beginning, but then again... it's only the weapons and pickups that wont spawn right.. so your choice). <BR><BR>SkareKrow has put together a kit to aid in mapping for Trepidation with Q3 Radiant. You can get that here: <A href="http://trepidation.tnlsoft.com/tr/files/trepradiant.rar">trepradiant.rar</A>. There are several threads in our forums as far as using this file. <A href="http://www.planettrepidation.com/forum/index.php?act=Search&CODE=show&searchid=704e6192e6d8d377d62133dcd2bed0f1&search_in=posts&result_type=topics&highlite=trepradiant">Check Them Out</A>. </P>
<P>We'll eventually have to recompile GtkRadiant itself with some new tools for the vehichles and whatever weapons we come up with... </P>
<P>The biggest challenge the mappers are having at the moment is all of the textures have to be original or fall under the GPL or equivilant license..</P>
<P>The current development build has a lot of textures in the zpakX-openmedia.pk3 which are all gpl. And of course anything in any Trep original map.<BR><BR><STRONG><A id=mapladders name=mapladders></A>MAPPING: LADDERS</STRONG><BR>Trepidation offers Ladder support that the original Quake3 code lacked. Map designers should make a box around your ladders. This box should be given a texture of "common/ladderclip". Make the box a lot smaller than you would in EF.<BR><BR><STRONG><A id=mapliquid name=mapliquid></A>MAPPING: LIQUID, LAVA, AND FOG.</STRONG> <BR><SPAN class=style1>textures/liquids/pool2<BR>textures/liquids/lavafloor<BR>textures/liquids/kc_fogcloud3</SPAN></P>
<P>Only one is water, the other too are (obviously) lava and fog. So far I've got them all at least scrolling correctly and bobbing up and down, but I can't get the transparancy to work for the water yet. I'll keep working on it. I'll try to upload a pk3 with the new shader later tonight if I've got time.<BR><BR><STRONG><A id=mapweapons name=mapweapons></A>MAPPING: WEAPONS</STRONG><BR>At this time, the new weapons do not have corresponding entities in Trepidation, they use the standard quake 3 weapon names. Here are the replacements:</P>
<P>Flame Thrower - Lightning Gun<BR>Singularity Cannon - Rocket Launcher<BR>Gauss Rifle - Rail Gun<BR><BR><STRONG>MAPPING: BREAKABLE ITEMS</STRONG><BR>Mappers need to first, make it a <STRONG><EM>func_door</EM></STRONG>(anything will do) then press "<STRONG>n</STRONG>" and change the <STRONG><EM>func_door</EM></STRONG> to <STRONG><EM>func_breakable</EM></STRONG>, or optionally edit the "entities.def" file and add in func_breakable, so you can just select it from the normal drop down list in Q3Radiant. They also need to set the life of the glass by pressing "n" while selecting the entity and in the key box type in "<STRONG><EM>health</EM></STRONG>" and in the value box type in whatever NUMBER of life it should have. If you dont it defaults to 5 life. <BR><BR>Your mapper needs to add the ifx.shader into their base/scripts directory <BR>You will want he/she to edit the shaderlist.txt in their base/scripts directory and add at the VERY bottom ifx<BR>Your mapper needs to have done that so upon compile it does the lightmap and everything correctly.<BR>

  You need to have an origin brush as part of this entity.  The center of that brush will be

<p>  Your mapper *should* know how to deal with this, but the programmer should also have a little insight on this as well. This is an entity definition for Q3Radiant. When added into the file, entities.def (via a text editor) , this will appear as an option available to the mapper when adding objects into the map, such as spawnpoints, weapons, and in this case, doors. The first line is very important as that tells the function in our actual code what spawnflags will be used for this particular object. The order of objects in the first line must not be altered in anyway, as that will cause instructional problems between the map's options and the code's functions.<br />
  <br />
  The remaining lines in the statement gives the mapper extra information on what to add to the object to actually make it work. Should the mapper forget some required values, such as the speed, we have placed a condition in our code so that a default value is used if this happens.</p>
