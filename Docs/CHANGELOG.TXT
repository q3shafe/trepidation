IMPORTANT NOTES BEFORE INSTALLING THIS:

OpenAL is updated.  Be sure to install it during the windows installer.  The new version should fix a lot of problems some folks where having.

Also.. If your installing over an older copy.. which ISNT recommended!  You should clear out your base folder of **ALL** pk3's.  If the old ones remain, you'll have all sorts of problems.

Also, dont copy over your config file, set it up from scratch, things have changed and you WILL have problems.

Another Good Idea is to turn your downloads on.  The test servers are setup to download very 
quickly via http from trepidation.u7net.com if there is a file you need.  So yeah, turn your
downloads on :)

09-07-06 svn version 144
==========================
- Shafe - Added in build rules for turrets.  The game must progress for trep gametype and ctf before better turrets can be built.

- SkareKrow -  Nightmare, dm_opposingforts, and an update for ctf_opposingforts so it wont let you play DM or TDM. Also has some new shaders and textures... now that I sort of understand textures. :-P

- Shafe - Added in a bit of Chris' unfinished music to the main menu.. I love it.. Hope that's ok chris :)

- Shafe - Re-did credits Screen, they now scroll with a new background graphic, and music.

- Shafe - Fixed bug where garbage was being sent to the console at the end of each round.

- Drakon - New Turret Model.. Not yet textured though.  But lookin good.   - Didnt have time to get this to place on the ground.. Will get to that later.

- Laz - New Map TES.

- Shafe - Added in /RCON balanceteams to balance teams :)  You can also vote on this. /callvote balanceteams

- Shafe - Turrets Fire Machine Gun Fire, Except for Cloaked Turrets.  Scratch this MG wasnt damaging anyone for some reason.

- Shafe - You can now tell what team Buildables objects are on.

- Shafe - Engine: Expanded Struct entityState_s to include team.

- Shafe - Master Server Website Now Reports Correctly With This Build.. (except for servers on my lan).

- Gigon - Small Armor Model -  Work in Porogress.

- Petee - New Machine Gun Model - Work in Progress.

- Gigabyte & Petee - Glass Models Added In

- Shafe - Maps with true Rotating Doors are now support.. no more sliding doors only. 

- Shafe - Slow weapon respawns on team games is stupid.

- Shafe - Fixed Gauntlet

- Shafe - Broke Gauntlet

- Shafe - Added in mp3 codec support.  Lots of new code for this, but thus far it isnt working.

- Shafe - Started Incorporating HUD.. Doesnt really work out with our current font.  We need to get the fonts worked out before we can implement the hud. 

- Shafe - Added in breakable Objects functions.. This is from a tutorial on code3arena, so I dont know if it works.. but here is the notes from the tutorial as well as some of my own.
Mappers need to first, make it a func_door(anything will do) then press "n" and change the func_door to func_breakable, or optionally edit the "entities.def" file and add in func_breakable, so you can just select it from the normal drop down list in Q3Radiant. They also need to set the life of the glass by pressing "n" while selecting the entity and in the key box type in "health" and in the value box type in whatever NUMBER of life it should have. If you dont it defaults to 5 life. 
Your mapper needs to add the ifx.shader into their base/scripts directory 
You will want he/she to edit the shaderlist.txt in their base/scripts directory and add at the VERY bottom ifx
Your mapper needs to have done that so upon compile it does the lightmap and everything correctly.

So this is all from a code3arena tutorial... I imagine the shader only has to do with rendering the glass model correctly.  If you dont assign a glass model (or whatever object it is that is breakable).  the following will be used:
models/breakables/glass01.md3
models/breakables/glass02.md3
models/breakables/glass03.md3


- Shafe - Added In Game Build Menu.. Very Crude.. 

- Shafe - Added 'Build' Bind to Controls->Misc in ui

- Shafe - Separated and Did Some Cleanup to Buildable Objects.  Moved into g_buildables.c

- Shafe - You can now shoot and destroy a pdg grenade.

- Chris - New Ambiant Sounds, New Flame Thrower Sound, and new fx sound for fire.

- SkareKrow - Replacement For Opposing Forts Maps with some fixes.

- SkareKrow - Added Replacement For Loading Bar

- Shafe - Added g_playerclass.c for playerclass framework.  WIP

- Shafe - Corrected issue with MAX RATE not sticking in network settings.  Max rate now defaults to LAN/CABLE

- Shafe - Corrected Issue: if cheats are on, you can execute them as spectator and if you are following someone it looks like they get it, ie: give quad damage gives them quad for like a second for some reason or at least it looks like it from your pov.


- Shafe - Added in /powerups/build shader, corresponding gfx and code for effects of an object being built.

- Shafe - Did some more work to get more EF Models to load.. .still a bit buggy.

- Shafe - Got Rid of Some of the leftover debugging that was getting printed to console.

- Shafe - When transporting using a PDG and carrying the flag the flag is now returned to the base instead of just dropped.

- Shafe - Crosshairhealth Really Shows health now.

- Shafe - Added in very basic code for Base thingy for gamemode 4.

- Shafe - Added in Very Basic shield Generator for Turrets and Base Thingy for gamemode 4.

- Shafe - 3 Type of turrets accessible.

- Shafe - Gata gun is a bit weaker.

- Shafe - You can now nextweapon or prevweapon to gauntlet (weapon 1).

- Shafe - If you try to use a console command during intermission, you are given an 'invalid during intermission' error instead of just printing it as chat text.

- Shafe - Security Fix: In short the problem is in how the engine handles the commands longer than 1022 chars, in fact they are automatically truncated at that size and the rest of the chars is handled as network data confusing the engine. 
If an attacker joins a server and sends a too big message any client in the server will automatically disconnect showing the "CL_ParseServerMessage: Illegible server message" error

==========================
07-27-06 svn version 126
==========================
- Shafe - Added in survival.cfg for a sample Survival server config.

- Shafe - Fixed a stupid thing in the engine.  'kick all' command.  Players like to come onto the server name themselves 'all' then try to get a callvote going to get themselves kicked and everyone ends up getting kicked when it passes.

- Shafe - In Arsenal and survival if you happen to blow yourself up while making the winning kill you will still win assuming you died last.  The game will not get stuck looking for a winner.

- Shafe - First Strike Code Now Works.. This was important in arsenal and survival.

- Shafe - in Arsenal & survival you are spectator when you connect, thus not having a round go on for 15 minutes, down to 2, then someone connects now it's unfairly 3.. the new people will need to wait to next round to play.

- Shafe - Did a bit of work to the connect screen.  Progress bar is still a bit screwy.

- Shafe - Added Callvote and Choose Class to the ingame menu but they dont do anything yet.

- Shafe - Add Bot, Remove Bot, and Restart Map never appear in the ingame menu when connected to a server. 

- Shafe - Added in Survival game mode (which right now is pretty bland and basic) the code was mostly there, being used for Arsenal.  Survival is g_GameMode 2.  We should come up with a better name.  survival in Trep is more similar to Gladiator in EF than Elimination or other Survival Game Types.

- Shafe - g_Arsenal is no longer... This is now g_GameMode
 	0 - Normal
	1 - Arsenal
	2 - Survival
	3 - ??

- Shafe - Created new gun, In place of the plasma gun.. fires razor sharp discs that bounce... this was skarekrow's idea.. it's very fun.. maybe a bit excessive though.  Need a model for the discs /models/weaphits/disc.md3 :)

- Shafe - Touched up the code for primary and alt fire on the devastator. 

- Shafe - Did some work to the flame thrower, trying to make it lag less and sound a bit better.  Needs more work.. some new sounds maybe.

- Shafe - Fixed bug where sometimes it would say the you died with the lighning gun instead of the flame thrower

- Petee - Singularity Cannon Trails Are Now Green :)

- SkareKrow - Revisied Blood.. mmmm.. blood.

- SkareKrow - All New Graphics for Medals (excellent, air kill, headshot, etc).

- Shafe - You no longer inherit the score of the person you are spectating.

- SkareKrow - Added in Many Missing Menu Buttons 

- SkareKrow - Many Maps Fixed up.

- SkareKrow - Crosshairs Created.

- Shafe - Engine - Updated Master Servers to point to master.planettrepidation.com

- Added in Support for MDR Player Models.   You can now use Quake 3 or ELite Force Player Models.  This gives us a great base of custom models to use :)  this was also hell to get working.  No really I mean hell

==========

- Shafe - game - tightened up the machine gun spread.. New machine gun code in future build

- Shafe ui -Added Arsenal Gametype to Server Browser

- Shafe - game - Added in Arsenal gametype.  g_Arsenal 1 to enable.  You actually need to configure the game beforehand otherwise it wont play correctly.  See Readme.txt.  This was added in at the last second so I'm sure it's buggy as hell.

- Sir Ender - Team Music and some additional sounds for shafe Added

- Picking up a dropped weapon can no longer put you over the maximum ammo allowed for that weapon.

- Shafe - cgame - Fudged up the scoreboard a bit.. it's ok though.. the font and icons are now a lot smaller and looks a hair better.. still has a long way to go.

- Shafe - cgame - Scoreboard now displays your accuracy, for weapons that use such a thing.

- Sir Ender - More Missing Announcer Sounds Filled In.

- Shafe - ui - made some changes in the code to reference buttons we had graphics for in the newly unlocked menus.  There are still some missing in the Play Offline section.

- Shafe - ui - Prettied up the menus a bit, I have to apologize in adavance for some of the contrast issues.. They'll be worked out.. 

- Shafe - Added Master server Selection to the Server Browser - Alternate 4 is for me.. since I host the master server on my lan I can only access it with a lan ip :( all of them are pointing to the same machine with different urls at the moment.

- Shafe - Engine: Added Support in Engine for Multiple Master Servers. 

- Shafe - Renamed the pk3 to something a bit more sensible apak* are things we plan to replace pak* are things we plan to keep.. and z* are whatever you added.

- Shafe - Removed various unreferenced locals from a variety of places for a cleaner compile

BUGS:
- The whole code for joining a game in arsenal is utter shit.  You pretty much have to join during warmup.  This is supposed to be after first strike.
- When Alt Firing and you run out of ammo weapon doesnt automatically switch.
- In Arsenal A new person connecting should not get thrown into a round already in progress they should be forced to spec until the next round.
- Server browser is a bit buggy when filtering gametype arsenal.

NOTES:
- When My ISP changed The test servers stopped reporting to the master without the port specified.. not sure what this is but if the primary master doesnt work for you switch to the second.
- First Strike code is kinda in there.. some sort of sound to specify first strike would be cool.
- Survival/Gladiator gametype is partially done.. but not yet implemented.
- The sound is amazingly better... unfortunately this has made the ALT Flame thrower sound like utter shit.. we need to fix this.


==========
BUILD 6-19
==========
sVN v## - Subversion Repository Revision
SF Task ## - Sourceforge Task List #

- Shafe - zpak-weapons - Since this pk3 represents weapons that arent ours and we cant use... I went ahead and found another railgun model and threw it in there cuz I hated the other one.. Can't use this one either... Copyright crap.. 

- Petee - Added some shaders textures/liquids/pool2, textures/liquids/lavafloor, textures/liquids/kc_fogcloud3  Only one is water, the other too are (obviously) lava and fog. So far I've got them all at least scrolling correctly and bobbing up and down, but I can't get the transparancy to work for the water yet. I'll keep working on it. 

- Petee - Glass Now Exists!  

- Shafe - cgame/game updated ammo pickups and alt ammo usage Grenade Ammo Pickups now 7 alt usage now 2, Singularity Cannon ammo pickups 6, Plasma Gun Alt Ammo Usage 3.

- Shafe - cgame - updated credits screen

- Shafe - zpak0-trepidation - Updated arenas.txt

- Shafe - game - Created Particle Displacement Grenades (PDG's) This is currently the ALT FIRE on the plasma gun.  This still needs some work as sometimes it is possible to transport into a wall.  This was a whole day of work.. hope y'all like it.

- Shafe - game - Revised primary fire on flame thrower. The flame balls really hurt now with a pretty intense splash radius...  Hopefully making primary fire a bit more useful

- Shafe - game/cgame - Reload time on the Gauss Rifle is slightly faster... Actually matched it with EF's Compression rifle. 

- SkareKrow zpak0-trepidation - New Map CTF_AVERSION.

- SkareKrow zpak0-trepidation - New Map Citadel

- Shafe - cgame/zpak0-trep.. - Created separate smoke shaders so that ONLY the singularity cannon has the wierd ring trail.

- Shafe - cgame/game - Mega Health is now called medkit - Mega health might have worked in 1997 but it's hella cheesy now.

- Shafe - cgame/game - You can no longer grab a weapon to replenish your ammo unless you are totally out of ammo for that weapon or you pickup a dropped weapon. Yes this took almost a 9 hours to perfect

- Shafe - cgame/game - Can now jump off of ladders... This code is wacky and needs to be revised so to not allow you to just jump up the ladder.

- Shafe - cgame/game - Can now wall jump on steeply sloped walls.. but not vertical walls.. This code is wacky and needs to be revised

- Shafe - Game - Seeking Singularity Cannon Bursts no longer shoot into the ground when there is no target around..  Really cleaned this up a bit.

- SkareKrow zpak0-trepidation - New Map Area52

- SkareKrow zpak0-trepidation - New gfx for scoreboard

-------------
BUILD 5-30-06
-------------
- Added in PTD (portable tracking device) heh. .A radar..  (Check CONTROLS->MISC).. But the  code that actually makes it work is twisted at the moment.. need more time on that one.. You can press and hold the key that you have binded to see the radar on the hud...   Also worth noting that it needs to be more visible... Might need some artwork for that.

- Shafe - game/zpak1-trepidation - Added in headshot sounds

- Shafe - game - Added MAX AMMO code for all weapons and set them at something I thought was ok for now... Q3 had no code for this.. simply all weapons had a max of 200.

- Shafe - UI - moved Alt Fire Around On The Menus.. Makes More sense... Renamed it to Secondary Fire

- Shafe - game/cgame - Changed the names of the railgun and rocket launcher.  M42 GAUSS RIFLE (railgun) and Singularity Cannon.. I Researched this shit so see the readme.. it's actually kinda interesting.. Still up for debate tho.

- Shafe - zpak-Weapons - Switched up The Rocket Launcher Model and Weapon fire.  

- Petee - Added some shaders textures/liquids/pool2, textures/liquids/lavafloor, textures/liquids/kc_fogcloud3  Only one is water, the other too are (obviously) lava and fog. So far I've got them all at least scrolling correctly and bobbing up and down, but I can't get the transparancy to work for the water yet. I'll keep working on it. 

- SkareKrow - zpak1-trepidation.pk3 -  Also replaced the chat icon that appears over you're head.

- SkareKrow - zpak1-trepidation.pk3 - put the files from the individual pk3 files for the maps into the trepidation pk3 file.  So it's a good idea to uninstall then reinstall this build to get rid of the old map pk3 files.

- SkareKrow - zpak1-trepidation.pk3 - put together an arena.txt file in the scripts for all the maps

- SkareKrow - zpak1-trepidation.pk3 - fixed up the oa_bases3 map and renamed it to Dread.

- Shafe - Game - Added in MultiJump Capabilities - g_MultiJump #  // Doesnt Work Yet See Comments on SF Task #127425

- Shafe - Updated server.cfg.

- Shafe - game - alt fire now has code to support different ammo usage than primary fire.  This still needs some work... Get down to 1 ammo and hit alt fire and you'll see what I mean

- Shafe - game - No more missing rocket models... Rockets are always registered.

- Shafe - master - Fixed up some of the master server code.  Now Compiles on windows.  - SVN v52

-------------
BUILD 5-21-06
-------------
- Shafe - Updated server.cfg and added new maps into rotation

- Shafe - q3_ui - Minor Changes to server browser screen.

- Shafe - zpak0-openmedia - Got rid of banner5.md3 it was bothering me.

- Shafe - q3_ui - Got rid of the rest of the annoying CD Key screen stuff

- Added some non-working filters to the server browser (for future use)

- Shafe - CTF_CONFLICTZONE added to installer

- Shafe - game/cgame - Rail Gun Equivilant now utilizes headshots.  If reg, headshot is instakill.  In either case the headshot is noted on the console and the player model head is actually blown off.  Too Graphic.. maybe.. but it's cool.

- Shafe - game - Alt Rocket is a little bit more seekery.. whatever that means and maybe less flickery.

- Shafe - game - Unlagged The Flame THrower

- Shafe - zpak0-trep - Updated CTF_OPPOSINGFORTS Map 

- Shafe - Engine - Updated engine to reflect correct master server

- Shafe - Master - Compiled Linux Build Of Master Server... It's up and running @ 70.84.61.148:27950

- Shafe - zpak0 - Changed the rail gun sound.. to a temporary sound I made.. The other one was driving me crazy.

- Shafe - Added in Ladder support.  game, cgame and in zpak-trepidation.pk3... 

		map designers [or for the versitile, do it yourself] make a box around your ladders. This box should be given a texture of "common/ladderclip". 
		PS: This does NOT add support to allow bots to use ladders.. that's elsewhere and forthcoming.

- Shafe - zpak0-trepidation.pk3 - Copied the Q3 /scripts/common.shader file into the trep pak.. This file will have to be totally redone though.

- Shafe - zpak0-trepidation.pk3 - Added in my personal config file shafe.cfg :)

- Shafe - game - Alt Fire Rocket now shoots seeking rockets... This still needs tweaked a bit.  And The Unlagged Client Side Prediction is off making them kinda flicker.

- Shafe - game - The railgun is no longer dropped when you are killed in instagib.

- Shafe - zpak0-trepidation.pk3 - Added in A Bot... Default Sarge Bot... /addbot sarge
