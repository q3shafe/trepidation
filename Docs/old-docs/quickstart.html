TREPIDATION </span></strong>(g_gamemode 3)<br />
A Team based game where the object is to destroy the other team&#8217;s Power Core to make a point for your team. Various defensive structures can be built to protect your base and achieve your goal. While this game employs strategy it is extremely fast paced and teamwork is a must.</p>
<p>Both teams are givin 35 seconds to build a power core at the start of each round or after each score. If the team fails to build one, one will be built automatically in a random spot on the map (most likely in a spot difficult to defend).</p>
<blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr">
<p align="left"><strong><em>Power Core:</em></strong></p>
<p>The power core must be destroyed by weapons fire or other such explosives. Destroying the power core will require multiple hits. When a sheild generator is present the power core becomes shielded and will regenerate. 2 shield generators will offer more protection and cause the power core to regenerate to a faster and to a higher level of health. A sheilded power core can be taken out without taking out the shield generators however it will take a significant amount of firepower, also so long as the shield generator(s) are operational, the power core&#8217;s shield and health will regenerate. Once it has sustained enough fire to take out the shield the shield will not re-activate and regeneration stops, regardless if a shield generator is present.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Shield Generators</em></strong></p>
<p>Each team can have up to 2 shield generators (1 at the start of the game). The shield generator is used to power shielding on the power core. So long at least one shield generator is active the health of the power core will regenerate. 2 Shield generators offer double the protection and the MC&#8217;s health will generate twice as high as it would without any shield generators.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Immobilizers</em></strong></p>
<p>Immobilizers are defensive devices that emit an immobilization field that causes foes to lose the ability to move. While it is possible to break free from an immobilizer field it can prove difficult. Immobilizers are best used in conjunction with turrets, as the immobiler will render the enemy immobile, the turret will finish the job. Immobilizers can be destroyed quite easily and work best when well concealed, unfortunately immobilizers are line of site devices, which means a clear path needs to be established between the enemy and the immobilizer</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 225px"><img title="Immobilizer" src="http://trepidation.u7net.com/man/immobilizer.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="398" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Immobilizer (Placeholder Model)</p></div>
<p><strong><em>Turrets</em></strong></p>
<p>A limited number of turrets can be created to help protect your MC and sheild generators. Turrets will seek and fire upon any enemy within the turret&#8217;s range. There are 3 types of turrets available throughout the game, better turrets become available as the game progresses. The 3 different types are:</p>
<blockquote style="margin-right: 0px;" dir="ltr"><p><strong>BASIC TURRET</strong></p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 239px"><img title="Bsaic Turret" src="http://trepidation.u7net.com/man/turret1.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="353" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Basic Turret (Placeholder Model)</p></div>
<p>Basic turrets will fire machine gun fire at a target. Basic turrets are the primary turret available at the start of the game. Basic can be shot down fairly easily and cause very little damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SHIELDED TURRET</strong></p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 239px"><img title="Shielded Turret" src="http://trepidation.u7net.com/man/turret2.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="353" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Shielded Turret</p></div>
<p>Shielded turrets are tougher than the basic turret, the turret&#8217;s health regenerates and the turret itself is protected by a sheild. Eventually with enough damage the shield will drop and the turret&#8217;s health will cease to regenerate. Damage caused by this turret is significantly greater than the basic turret.</p>
<p><strong>CLOAKED TURRET</strong></p>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 249px"><img class=" " title="Cloaked Turret" src="http://trepidation.u7net.com/man/turret3.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="326" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Cloaked Turret</p></div>
<p>Cloaked turrets are the most powerful turret in the game. These turrets remain invisible and only appear when a target is in range.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Building turrets next to your power core is not recommended as a turret can be destroyed easier than the power core and any splash damage from a turret exploding will cause damage to the power core.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">DEATHMATCH/FREE FOR ALL</span></strong> (g_gametype 0)<br />
As the title implies this is every person for themselves. The goal of a deathmatch game is to kill (or &#8220;frag&#8221;) as many other players as possible until a certain condition or limit is reached, commonly being a fraglimit or timelimit. Once one of these conditions is met, the match is over, and the winner is whoever has accumulated the most frags. It is based around the idea of player spawns, and weapon/item/pickup spawns in one play session</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
TEAM DEATHMATCH<br />
</span></strong>Same as above but in team fashion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">TOURNEY<br />
</span></strong>A tournament game is implicitly a one on one match, and further players are automatically entered as spectators (note, when the game starts, all clients, including the spectators respawn). You can follow the players by using “team follow1”, “team follow2”, and you can be a scoreboard by using “team scoreboard”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">CAPTURE THE FLAG<br />
</span></strong>Capture The Flag (CTF) is a traditional game where two teams each have a flag and the objective is to capture the other team&#8217;s flag, located at the team&#8217;s &#8220;base&#8221;, and bring it back to their own base.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">INSTAGIB.<br />
</span></strong>Instagib can be played in most gametypes. In instagib all players carry only a M42Gauss Rifle, which has infinite ammunition and fires instantly lethal shots with infinite velocity, at a low rate of fire. Since everyone always has the same weapon and there are no health, ammo or other pickups to collect, gameplay tends to have a heavy emphasis on reflexes, hand-eye coordination and positioning, as opposed to resource management and control. Because every single shot can instantly explode an enemy from any range, gameplay also tends to be very fast paced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">ARSENAL</span> </strong>(g_gamemode 2)<br />
In Arsenal, You start out with an Arsenal of weapons pre-determined by the server admin. unlimited ammo and If you die your weapon is dropped (free for anyone to salvage) and you dont get it back.</p>
<p>The Object, is not to let your arsenal empty out. If you run out of weapons you are out of the game until the next round.</p>
<p>To win, stay alive, and be the last person standing. Things heat up when it gets down to 2 people. When there are only 2 people left Showdown starts, the last stage of the game becomes increasingly difficult as you&#8217;ll find that powerups, armor and health become more and more scarce..</p>
<p>If you pickup a weapon that isnt in your arsenal, you can use it until you die, but it doesnt get placed into your arsenal.</p>
<p>Game Tips: pickup every weapon you see, if it&#8217;s a weapon you dont have be sure to use it, because if you get killed with it you wont lose a weapon out of your arsenal, as it will give you a longer run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">SURVIVAL</span> </strong>(g_gamemode 2)<br />
Last Man Standing is typically played in with g_gametype set to 0/Deathmatch, however LMS can be played in Team Deathmatch as well. In LMS each player is randomly given a single weapon with unlimited ammo from the pool of weapons</p>
<p>available (specified by the server admin). The object of Last Man Standing is exactly as the name implies. Be the last person standing. Do not get killed (even once!) as you will be eliminated for the remainder of the round.</p>
