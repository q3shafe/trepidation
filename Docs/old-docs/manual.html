The default settings are pretty low end. The first thing you will want to do, aside from setup your controls is setup your video settings. Most modern computers (and even my computer) can run a lot higher than the defaults.

Also check your Net connection settings.

There is a working master server so you should be able to find the test servers.

As Trepidation is a work in progress. Only a handful of weapons have been completed and even fewer original weapon models are in place. The new weapons are listed below, the remaining weapons are quake 3 defaults and may have no secondary fire capabilities.

<strong>LFO Rifle</strong> (Weapon 2)
The Low Frequency Oscillation Rifle is a standard issue weapon for humans. The weapon is powered by rechargable cells that automatically regenerate. The weapon fires low frequency oscillating pulses at a high rate of fire.

<strong>Primary fire</strong> fires low frequency oscillating pulses at a high rate of fire.
<strong>Alternate Fire</strong> fires larger and more powerful low frequency oscillating pulses at a high rate of fire.
<ul>
 	<li>Initial Ammo: 50</li>
 	<li>Max Ammo: 150</li>
 	<li>Ammo Pickups: 20</li>
 	<li>Seconary Attack Ammo Usage: 2</li>
</ul>
<strong>GRENADE LAUNCHER</strong> (Weapon 4)
Functions much like the Quake 3 grenade launcher.

<strong>Primary fire</strong> bounces for a few seconds before exploding.
<strong>Alternate Fire</strong> explodes on impact.

The alt-fire grenade can be used for rocket jumping style manuevers
<ul>
 	<li>Initial Ammo: 10</li>
 	<li>Max Ammo: 50</li>
 	<li>Ammo Pickups: 7</li>
 	<li>Seconary Attack Ammo Usage: 2</li>
</ul>
<strong>SINGULARITY CANNON</strong> (Weapon 5)
The singularity cannon produces an unstable quantum singularity on the fly which is launched causing significant damage as well as a fair amount splash damage. This weapon is powered by Singularity Reactor Rods.

<strong>Alternate fire</strong> adds a quantum memory to the projectile which can be used to track and lock onto potential targets.
<ul>
 	<li>Initial Ammo: 10</li>
 	<li>Max Ammo: 30</li>
 	<li>Ammo Pickups: 6</li>
 	<li>Seconary Attack Ammo Usage: 3</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>FLAME THROWER(Weapon 6)
</strong>The flame thrower is a brand new weapon that replaces the lighning gun.

<strong>Primary fire</strong>: of the flame thrower shoots balls of fire.
<strong>Alternate Fire</strong>: fires more like a conventional flame thrower. That is a single stream of fire. Beware, alt fire uses a lot of ammo and you can easily burn yourself with the flames.
<ul>
 	<li>Initial Ammo: 300</li>
 	<li>Max Ammo: 400</li>
 	<li>Ammo Pickups: 25</li>
 	<li>Seconary Attack Ammo Usage: 1 (goes quick tho)</li>
</ul>
<strong>
M42 GAUSS RIFLE</strong> (Weapon 7)
A coilgun (also known as Gauss gun or Gauss rifle) is a type of cannon that uses a series of electromagnets to accelerate a magnetic shell to very high velocities. Coilguns are often mistakenly called railguns by many sources, and while they are similar in general concept (that is, a magnetic gun), they differ in operation, as a railgun accelerates projectiles down two parallel conducting rails. Coilguns are essentially, identical to mass drivers, though on a smaller scale. ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss_gun )

<strong>Primary fire</strong> is a very focused shot.
<strong>Alternate Fire </strong>is a powerful zooming scope. .
<ul>
 	<li>Initial Ammo: 10</li>
 	<li>Max Ammo: 50</li>
 	<li>Ammo Pickups: 10</li>
 	<li>Seconary Attack Ammo Usage: NA</li>
</ul>
<strong>
GATA GUN (X)
Primary Fire</strong>: Fires a bunch of Frisbees… I’ll figure out the details on explaining this one later.. they are really razor sharp discs… that bounce around the environment… Aside from figuring out the explanation I’d like to find a better name for this one.

<strong>Alternate fire</strong>: fires a particle displacement grenade (PDG). This weapon fires a projectile. From the time you fire the projectile you have 30 seconds to obtain a lock and use it. A lock is only obtained once the projectile lands and comes to a complete stop. Once a lock is obtained you can then press the PDG key and you transport to the location of the projectile location. The projectile expires when you fire another or after 30 seconds. The 30 seconds begins from the time you fire the projectile. The keybinding is in OPTIONS-&gt;CONTROLS-&gt;MISC. Be careful though.. If you transport into a wall you may be stuck.
<ul>
 	<li>Initial Ammo:</li>
 	<li>Max Ammo: 200</li>
 	<li>Ammo Pickups:</li>
 	<li>Seconary Attack Ammo Usage: 12</li>
</ul>
<strong>
DEVASTATOR (Weapon 9)
</strong>The devestator is the most powerful weapon available in Trepidation. The devastator fires high energy plasma projectiles. The power behind this weapon causes the projectiles to be very heavy and delivers a huge explosion.

<strong>Primary Fire:</strong> fires a very powerful, SLOW moving burst, the projectile is affected a bit by gravity. Direct hits are deadly and splash damage is fairly large.

<strong>Alternate Fire:</strong> is similar to primary fire except the projectile is a lot larger and it will explode twice after a few seconds into a total of 6 projectiles which will cause significant damage to the entire area. It’s good to be far away from the area when this happens. The reload time for alt fire is about 3 1/2 seconds. With the Devastator’s secondary fire, it’s best to aim high and get out of dodge. The Devastator is not practical in enclosed spaces, as anyone within the range of its large explosion will take damage regardless of their amounts of armor and health…

Each time…
<ul>
 	<li>Initial Ammo: 6</li>
 	<li>Max Ammo: 20</li>
 	<li>Ammo Pickups: 5</li>
 	<li>Seconary Attack Ammo Usage: 3</li>

NOTE: Please bear with all the place-holder models and the state of this guide. This is a work in progress.

<strong>
TREPIDATION </strong>(g_gamemode 3)
A Team based game where the object is to destroy the other team’s Power Core to make a point for your team. Various defensive structures can be built to protect your base and achieve your goal. While this game employs strategy it is extremely fast paced and teamwork is a must.

Both teams are givin 35 seconds to build a power core at the start of each round or after each score. If the team fails to build one, one will be built automatically in a random spot on the map (most likely in a spot difficult to defend).
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p align="left"><strong><em>Power Core:</em></strong></p>
The power core must be destroyed by weapons fire or other such explosives. Destroying the power core will require multiple hits. When a shield generator is present the power core becomes shielded and will regenerate. 2 shield generators will offer more protection and cause the power core to regenerate to a faster and to a higher level of health. A shielded power core can be taken out without taking out the shield generators however it will take a significant amount of firepower, also so long as the shield generator(s) are operational, the power core’s shield and health will regenerate. Once it has sustained enough fire to take out the shield the shield will not re-activate and regeneration stops, regardless if a shield generator is present.
<div class="wp-caption alignnone">

<p class="wp-caption-text">Shielded Power Code (Placeholder Model)</p>

</div>
&nbsp;

<strong><em>Shield Generators</em></strong>

Each team can have up to 2 shield generators (1 at the start of the game). The shield generator is used to power shielding on the power core. So long at least one shield generator is active the health of the power core will regenerate. 2 Shield generators offer double the protection and the power core’s health will generate twice as high as it would without any shield generators.
<div class="wp-caption alignnone">

<img class=" " title="Power Generator" src="/man/gen.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="362" />
<p class="wp-caption-text">Shield Generator (placeholder model)</p>

</div>
&nbsp;

<strong><em>Immobilizers</em></strong>

Immobilizers are defensive devices that emit an immobilization field that causes foes to lose the ability to move. While it is possible to break free from an immobilizer field it can prove difficult. Immobilizers are best used in conjunction with turrets, as the immobilizer will render the enemy immobile, the turret will finish the job. Immobilizers can be destroyed quite easily and work best when well concealed, unfortunately immobilizers are line of site devices, which means a clear path needs to be established between the enemy and the immobilizer
<div class="wp-caption alignnone">

<img title="Immobilizer" src="/man/immobilizer.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="398" />
<p class="wp-caption-text">Immobilizer (Placeholder Model)</p>

</div>
<strong><em>Turrets</em></strong>

A limited number of turrets can be created to help protect your Power Core and shield generators. Turrets will seek and fire upon any enemy within the turret’s range. There are 3 types of turrets available throughout the game, better turrets become available as the game progresses. The 3 different types are:
<blockquote dir="ltr"><strong>BASIC TURRET</strong>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone">

<img title="Bsaic Turret" src="/man/turret1.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="353" />
<p class="wp-caption-text">Basic Turret (Placeholder Model)</p>

</div>
Basic turrets will fire machine gun fire at a target. Basic turrets are the primary turret available at the start of the game. Basic can be shot down fairly easily and cause very little damage.

&nbsp;

<strong>SHIELDED TURRET</strong>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone">

<img title="Shielded Turret" src="/man/turret2.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="353" />
<p class="wp-caption-text">Shielded Turret</p>

</div>
Shielded turrets are tougher than the basic turret, the turret’s health regenerates and the turret itself is protected by a shield. Eventually with enough damage the shield will drop and the turret’s health will cease to regenerate. Damage caused by this turret is significantly greater than the basic turret.

<strong>CLOAKED TURRET</strong>
<div class="wp-caption alignnone">

<img class=" " title="Cloaked Turret" src="/man/turret3.jpg" alt="" width="239" height="326" />
<p class="wp-caption-text">Cloaked Turret</p>

</div>
Cloaked turrets are the most powerful turret in the game. These turrets remain invisible and only appear when a target is in range.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
Building turrets next to your power core is not recommended as a turret can be destroyed easier than the power core and any splash damage from a turret exploding will cause damage to the power core.

<strong>DEATHMATCH/FREE FOR ALL</strong> (g_gametype 0)
As the title implies this is every person for themselves. The goal of a deathmatch game is to kill (or “frag”) as many other players as possible until a certain condition or limit is reached, commonly being a fraglimit or timelimit. Once one of these conditions is met, the match is over, and the winner is whoever has accumulated the most frags. It is based around the idea of player spawns, and weapon/item/pickup spawns in one play session

<strong>
TEAM DEATHMATCH
</strong>Same as above but in team fashion.

&nbsp;

<strong>TOURNEY
</strong>A tournament game is implicitly a one on one match, and further players are automatically entered as spectators (note, when the game starts, all clients, including the spectators respawn). You can follow the players by using “team follow1”, “team follow2”, and you can be a scoreboard by using “team scoreboard”.

&nbsp;

<strong>CAPTURE THE FLAG
</strong>Capture The Flag (CTF) is a traditional game where two teams each have a flag and the objective is to capture the other team’s flag, located at the team’s “base”, and bring it back to their own base.  An interesting additional to this classic gametype is the ability to build gun turrets to help you defend your base.

&nbsp;

<strong>INSTAGIB.
</strong>Instagib can be played in most gametypes. In instagib all players carry only a M42Gauss Rifle, which has infinite ammunition and fires instantly lethal shots with infinite velocity, at a low rate of fire. Since everyone always has the same weapon and there are no health, ammo or other pickups to collect, gameplay tends to have a heavy emphasis on reflexes, hand-eye coordination and positioning, as opposed to resource management and control. Because every single shot can instantly explode an enemy from any range, gameplay also tends to be very fast paced.

&nbsp;

<strong>ARSENAL </strong>(g_gamemode 2)
In Arsenal, You start out with an Arsenal of weapons pre-determined by the server admin. unlimited ammo and If you die your weapon is dropped (free for anyone to salvage) and you dont get it back.

The Object, is not to let your arsenal empty out. If you run out of weapons you are out of the game until the next round.

To win, stay alive, and be the last person standing. Things heat up when it gets down to 2 people. When there are only 2 people left Showdown starts, the last stage of the game becomes increasingly difficult as you’ll find that powerups, armor and health become more and more scarce..

If you pickup a weapon that isnt in your arsenal, you can use it until you die, but it doesnt get placed into your arsenal.

Game Tips: pickup every weapon you see, if it’s a weapon you dont have be sure to use it, because if you get killed with it you wont lose a weapon out of your arsenal, as it will give you a longer run.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong>SURVIVAL </strong>(g_gamemode 2)
Last Man Standing is typically played in with g_gametype set to 0/Deathmatch, however LMS can be played in Team Deathmatch as well. In LMS each player is randomly given a single weapon with unlimited ammo from the pool of weapons

available (specified by the server admin). The object of Last Man Standing is exactly as the name implies. Be the last person standing. Do not get killed (even once!) as you will be eliminated for the remainder of the round.

<strong>
</strong><strong>ONE4ALL</strong>(g_gamemode 2)

In One For All you start out with a random weapon.  There are no ammo or weapon pickups, so you have to make due with the weapon your given or kill someone with a better weapon and pick it up.  Ammo on all weapons is unlimited.

In addition Trepidation has a whole set of it’s own CVARs listed below:

<strong>g_instagib</strong> 0-off/1-on : Instagib one shot kill game mode.

<strong>g_Turrets</strong> 0-off/1-on : Disables/Enables the ability to build turrets on CTF games.

<strong>g_MaxTurrets</strong> : Set the maximum number of turrets allowed per team on CTF Games.

<strong>g_GameMode</strong>

<p dir="ltr"><strong>g_PCTeamkill</strong> – 1 = Can Destroy Your Own Power Core // 2 = You cannot destroy your own Power core</p>
<strong>g_mulitjump</strong> – xxx Not Yet Implented

The following CVARs designate what weapons are available on each map if you turn the Flame Thrower off, the Flame Thrower will no longer spawn on maps which contain it. In the Arsenal game mode these are used to specify the weapons each player is given in their arsenal. In the Last Man Standing game mode these are used to determine which weapons can be randomly handed out at the beginning of each round

The balance team commands will re-arrange teams when teams are off so that they are even. This is done by picking a random player (or 2) from the team with more players and moving them to the team with fewer players. Players that are moved get to keep their score. This command can also be voted on.

There are two ways to use VoIP in ioquake3. You can either use Mumble as an
external program, for which ioq3 now supplies some basic hooks, or you can
use the new built-in VoIP support.

Mumble is here: http://mumble.sourceforge.net/ … ioquake3 can supply it
with your in-game position, but everything else is whatever features Mumble
offers outside of the game. To use it, start Mumble before you start ioq3,
and run the game with +set cl_useMumble 1. This should work on at least
Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows, and probably other platforms Mumble supports
in the future.

The built-in stuff offers tighter in-game integration, works on any platform
that ioquake3 supports, and doesn’t require anything more than a recent build
of the game. The rest of this document is concerned with the built-in VoIP
support.

<strong>THE EASY WAY:</strong>
The simple way to get voip up in running is to use the system default method which
is the ingame support using push to talk.  There are two settings to set this up.

1) First enable Voice/Voip by entering SETUP-&gt;GAME OPTIONS and make sure
Voice/Voip is enabled.

2) Next choose a key to use as your Push to Talk key by entering SETUP-&gt;CONTROLS-&gt;MISC.
The default key is V.

<strong>The Long Version</strong>
Quick start for servers:
- run a recent build of ioquake3.
- Make sure your network settings are set to broadband.

Quick start for clients:
- run a recent build of ioquake3.
- Make sure your network settings are set to broadband.
- +set snd_useOpenAL 1
- \bind q “+voiprecord”
- Hook up a microphone, connect to a VoIP-supporting server.
- hold down ‘q’ key and talk.

Cvars you can set:

sv_voip: set to “1″ (the default) to enable server-side VoIP support. Set to
“0″ to disable. Without this, all VoIP packets are refused by the
server, which means no one gets to use in-game VoIP.

cl_voip: set to “1″ (the default) to enable client-side VoIP support. Set to “0″
to disable. Without this, you will neither be able to transmit voice nor
hear other people.

s_alCapture: set to “1″ (the default) to have the audio layer open an OpenAL
capture device. Without this set on sound startup, you’ll never
get bits from the microphone. This means you won’t transmit, but
you can still hear other people.

cl_voipSendTarget: a string: “all” to broadcast to everyone, “none” to send
to no one, “attacker” to send to the last person that hit
you, “crosshair” to send to the people currently in your
crosshair, or a comma-separated list of client numbers, like
“0,7,2,23″ … an empty string is treated like “all”. This
is reset to “all” when connecting to a new server.
Presumably mods will manage this cvar, not people, but
keybind could be useful for the general cases. To send to
just your team, or the opposing team, or a buddy list, you
have to set a list of numbers.

cl_voipUseVAD: set to “1″ to automatically send audio when the game thinks you
are talking, “0″ (the default) to require the user to manually
start transmitting, presumably with a keybind.

cl_voipVADThreshold: only used if cl_voipUseVAD is “1″ … a value between
0.0 and 1.0 that signifies the volume of recorded audio
that the game considers to be speech. You can use this
to trim out breathing or perhaps the sound of your
fingers tapping the keyboard and only transmit audio
louder than that. You will have to experiment to find the
value that works best for your hardware and play style.
The default is “0.25″, with “0.0″ being silence and “1.0″
being pretty-darn-loud.

cl_voipSend: when set to “1″, the game will capture audio from the microphone
and transmit it, when “0″, the game will not. The game can
optimize for the “0″ case (perhaps turning off audio recording).
Lots of things set this on and off, including cl_voipUseVAD, so
you probably should not touch this directly without knowing what
you’re doing, but perhaps mods can make use of it.

cl_voipGainDuringCapture: This is the volume (“gain”) of audio coming out of
your speakers while you are recording sound for
transmission. This is a value between 0.0 and 1.0,
zero being silence and one being no reduction in
volume. This prevents audio feedback and echo and
such, but if you’re listening in headphones that
your mic won’t pick up, you don’t need to turn down
the gain. Default is 0.2 (20% of normal volume). You
ABSOLUTELY want to make your speakers quiet when you
record, if the microphone might pick it up!

cl_voipShowMeter: Set to “1″ (the default) to show a volume meter as you are
recording from the microphone, so you can see how well the
game can “hear” you. Set to “0″ to disable the display of
the meter.

cl_voipCaptureMult: Multiply recorded audio by this value after denoising.
Defaults to 2.0 to _double_ the volume of your voice.
This is to make you more audible if denoising eats away
too much data. Set this to 1.0 to get no change, less to
be quieter.

Console commands:

voip ignore
Turn off incoming voice from player number . This will refuse to
play any incoming audio from that player, and instruct the server to stop
sending it, to save bandwidth. Use unignore to reenable. This is reset to
unignored when (re)connecting to a server.

voip gain unignore
Turn on incoming voice from player number . This will start
playing audio from this player again if you’ve previously done a “voip
ignore”, and instruct the server to start sending her voice packets to
you again.

voip gain muteall
Turn off all incoming voice. This will refuse to play any incoming audio,
and instruct the server to stop sending it, to save bandwidth. Use
unmuteall to reenable. This is reset to unmuted when (re)connecting to
a server.

voip gain unmuteall
Turn on incoming voice. This will start playing audio again if you’ve
previously done a “voip muteall”, and instruct the server to start
sending voice packets to you again.

voip gain
Sets the volume (“gain”) for player number to …
A gain of 0.0 is silence, and 2.0 doubles the volume. Use this if someone
is too quiet or too loud.

Actions:

+voiprecord: The action you should bind to a key to record. This basically
toggles cl_voipSend on and off. You don’t need this if you’re
using cl_voipUseVAD, since that’ll just record all the time and
decide what parts of the recording are worth sending.

More detailed/technical info:

By default, all of this is enabled. You can build with or without VoIP
support explicitly with USE_VOIP=[1|0] on the make command line.

You currently must use OpenAL to speak, as we have ALC_EXT_capture support
in place to pull data from the microphone. If you are using the SDL backend,
you can still hear people, but not speak.

There is no in-game UI to speak of: we encourage mods to add some. Largely
they will just need to set cvars and run console commands for choosing
voice targets and ignoring people, etc.

This requires patched builds to be useful, but remains network compatible with
legacy quake3 clients and servers. Clients and servers both report in their
info strings whether they support VoIP, and won’t send VoIP data to those not
reporting support. If a stray VoIP packet makes it to a legacy build, it will
be ignored without incident.

VoIP packets are saved in demo files! You will be able to playback what you
heard and what you said on VoIP-compatible clients. Legacy clients can also
play demo files with VoIP packets in them, but just won’t play the voice
track. For VoIP-supported builds, it’s nice to have a record of the
trash-talk.

Data is processed using the Speex narrowband codec, and is cross-platform.
Bigendian and littleendian systems can speak to each other, as can 32 and
64-bit platforms.

Bandwidth: VoIP data is broken up into 20 millisecond frames (this is a Speex
requirement), and we try to push up to 12 Speex frames in one UDP packet
(about a quarter of a second of audio)…we’re using the narrowband codec:
8000Hz sample rate. In practice, a client should send about 2 kilobytes per
second more when speaking, spread over about four bursts per second, plus a
few bytes of state information. For comparison, this is less than the server
sends when downloading files to the client without an http redirect. The
server needs to rebroadcast the packet to all clients that should receive it
(which may be less than the total connected players), so servers should
assume they’ll need to push (number of players speaking at once times number
of people that should hear it) * 2 kilobytes per second. It shouldn’t be a
problem for any client or server on a broadband connection, although it may
be painful for dialup users (but then again, everything is. They can just
disable the cvar). The game will refuse to enable VoIP support if your have
your network settings lower than “Cable/xDSL/LAN”, just in case.

The initial VoIP work was done by Ryan C. Gordon , and
he can be contacted with technical questions, if the ioq3 mailing list or
forums aren’t helpful.

<h2>Mapping For Trepidation</h2>

While there is a planned EF Compatability layer so that EF Maps will run on it as well as Quake 3 maps it has yet to be implemented. For the best luck as far as mapping for Trepidation is to use GtkRadiant or Q3Radiant, Since the game will eventually run any EF map and any Q3 map.. EF Radiant, GtkRadiant or Q3Radiant will suffice… At the moment only q3 maps will spawn weapons/ammo/etc.. (so Q3Radiant might be better in the beginning, but then again… it’s only the weapons and pickups that wont spawn right.. so your choice).

SkareKrow has put together a kit to aid in mapping for Trepidation with Q3 Radiant. You can get that here: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130628043211/http://trepidation.tnlsoft.com/tr/files/trepradiant.rar">trepradiant.rar</a>. There are several threads in our forums as far as using this file. <a href="http://trepidation.n5net.com/forum/index.php?board=4.0">Check Them Out</a>.

We’ll eventually have to recompile GtkRadiant itself with some new tools for the vehichles and whatever weapons we come up with…

The biggest challenge the mappers are having at the moment is all of the textures have to be original or fall under the GPL or equivilant license..

The current development build has a lot of textures in the zpakX-openmedia.pk3 which are all gpl. And of course anything in any Trep original map.

<strong>MAPPING: LADDERS</strong>

Trepidation offers Ladder support that the original Quake3 code lacked. Map designers should make a box around your ladders. This box should be given a texture of “common/ladderclip”. Make the box a lot smaller than you would in EF.

<strong>MAPPING: LIQUID, LAVA, AND FOG.</strong>

<span class="style1">textures/liquids/pool2</span>

textures/liquids/lavafloor

textures/liquids/kc_fogcloud3

Only one is water, the other too are (obviously) lava and fog. So far I’ve got them all at least scrolling correctly and bobbing up and down, but I can’t get the transparancy to work for the water yet. I’ll keep working on it. I’ll try to upload a pk3 with the new shader later tonight if I’ve got time.

<strong>MAPPING: WEAPONS</strong>

At this time, the new weapons do not have corresponding entities in Trepidation, they use the standard quake 3 weapon names. Here are the replacements:

Flame Thrower – Lightning Gun

Singularity Cannon – Rocket Launcher

Gauss Rifle – Rail Gun

<strong>MAPPING: BREAKABLE ITEMS</strong>

Mappers need to first, make it a <strong><em>func_door</em></strong>(anything will do) then press “<strong>n</strong>” and change the <strong><em>func_door</em></strong> to <strong><em>func_breakable</em></strong>, or optionally edit the “entities.def” file and add in func_breakable, so you can just select it from the normal drop down list in Q3Radiant. They also need to set the life of the glass by pressing “n” while selecting the entity and in the key box type in “<strong><em>health</em></strong>” and in the value box type in whatever NUMBER of life it should have. If you dont it defaults to 5 life.

Your mapper needs to add the ifx.shader into their base/scripts directory

You will want he/she to edit the shaderlist.txt in their base/scripts directory and add at the VERY bottom ifx

Your mapper needs to have done that so upon compile it does the lightmap and everything correctly.

<strong>MODELS GENERAL:</strong>

Trepidation supports Quake 3′s MD3 format as well as the later MD4/MDR format featured in games like Elite Force.  As of November 2011 Trepidation also support the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130628043211/http://lee.fov120.com/iqm/" target="_blank">Inter-Quake Model format</a> (IQM)

<em>More on this soon</em>

<strong>PLAYER MODELS</strong>

Trepidation will recognized player skins created for Quake 3 as well as Star Trek Voyager Elite Force. The Elite Force MDR file format and directory structure is the preferred format as it offers additional options for custom sounds, however the Quake 3 MD3 based format will work as well.

<em>More on the exact formats soon.</em>
