===================================
Trepidation 02-01-07 Linux
http://www.planettrepidation.com
===================================
OVERVIEW:
This archive contains binaries for Trepidation dedicated server, the game client and all game media

The client is built with no mp3 support You'll need  libmad-dev to compile it.  
You shouldnt run into problems aside from in custom player models.

=====================
BUILDING FROM SOURCE
=====================
If you need to build from source the source code can be checked out from our subversion repository here:

svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/trepidation trepidation 

You can view the repository on the web here:
http://svn.sourceforge.net/trepidation/

INSTALLING
When unpacking the zip/tar you should have a directory called trepidation.
Within that directory you should have the binaries as well as a folder called 'base' containing the game media.

The binaries are as follows:
trepded.i386     - Dedicated Server Binary
trepidation.i386 - 32 bit Game Client (run this one)
trepidation-smp.i386 - 32 Bit Game Client optimized for dual processors.

RUNNING A SERVER
If your familiar with running a quake 3 server it should be pretty easy. 
Eventually I'll write up more on this.  

The CHANGELOG and other Readable stuff can be found in the directory 
called Docs
