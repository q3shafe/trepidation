===================================
OVERVIEW:
This archive contains binaries for Trepidation dedicated server, the game client and all game media

=====================
BUILDING FROM SOURCE
=====================
If you need to build from source the source code can be checked out from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/q3shafe/trepidation.git

You can view the repository on the web here:
https://github.com/q3shafe/trepidation

INSTALLING
When unpacking the zip/tar you should have a directory called trepidation.
Within that directory you should have the binaries as well as a folder called 'base' containing the game media.

The binaries are as follows:
trepded.i386     - 32 Bit Dedicated Server Binary
trepidation.i386 - 32 bit Game Client 
trepidation.x86_64 - 64 bit Game Client 
trepded.x86_64 - 64 bit Dedicated Server Binary
RUNNING A SERVER
If your familiar with running a quake 3 server it should be pretty easy. 
Eventually I'll write up more on this.  

The CHANGELOG and other Readable stuff can be found in the directory 
called Docs
