Designer's note:-
		After the public death of my first
		Q3A player model, the Cacodemon, I
		quickly rushed to fill the void by
		starting work on this model. It only
		took a few days to complete, and
		with that aspect in mind, I couldn't
		be happier with it, except for the
		fact that I kind of went a bit
		overboard with the polygon count. 
		Not much else to say really, except
		that now I have using MD3s pretty 
		much figured out, I feel confident I 
		can keep spitting out Q3A player 
		models at a decent rate. Onto the 
		next one, Clobber the clown.
