Designer's note:-
		This is very unusual for me. I spent
		but a few hours on this, and for one
		with average knowledge of 3D model
		construction to have a look at this,
		one would see that it is just simple
		shapes carelessly 'whacked' together,
		yet this weapon doesn't look too bad
		at all. It really does seem like the
		less effort I put into something, the
		better the end result. Well, not
		exactly but my previous effort, the
		Railgun, took me a lot longer yet
		produced less of an end result, in my
		opinion. If it's not complete crap,
		though, I should be happy enough. I'm
		pleased with this model considering
		the time and effort I contributed.
