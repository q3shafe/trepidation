Known Bugs/design flaws:-
		Screwed up mesh on the eyes. 
		Wings go through walls and floor.
		Limbs intersect.
		Jerking in the idle animations.

Designer's note:-
		The head is a mess. I grouped it all
		together before fine tuning the mesh
		so I got myself into trouble there
		and just left it that way, so the
		texture is stretch over the eye and
		that looks very ugly. As for the rest
		of it, I'm very much happy with it's 
		overall appearance and it's	
		proformance. I went a bit overboard
		with the skin count, ending up with
		16 colourations from about 3 original
		images. The wings, although they look
		quite splendid, are a bit of a 
		problem with small enclosed areas or
		with the model right up against a 
		wall, but then a lot of other models
		do encounter the very same problem,
		many far worse. There's also plenty
		or opportunites for the limbs to 
		intersect, like crouching and firing
		at the same time. Crouching also 
		sees the wings enter the ground.
		There was also a problem with the
		idle animation jerking. I have no
		idea why this is but I'm not going
		to spend time thinking about fixing
		that kind of problem. Besides that,
		I think the animations have a lot
		of character and I'm happy enough
		with the entire model, despite it's
		many imperfections.
