Designer's note:-
		Looks pretty menacing, doesn't it?
		Of course it does, you say "Ouch! I
		wouldn't want to accidently sit on
		that!" so my job was successful, and 
		at 390 triangles, it won't be avoided 		
		due to FPS drops. However, like my 
		BFG10k, I was too lazy to worry about 
		LOD. This was mainly due to the fact
		that I couldn't have really shaved
		off too much from both models, and I
		couldn't be bothered. If it causes so
		much strife you probably need an
		upgrade, I know I certainly do. Okay,
		that was rude, but pfffft all at you!
		Downside about this model is that its 		
		flash MD3 is pretty detailed, using a
		few different shaders there. I was
		going to put some blood on the saw
		and also on the blades, but got too
		fed up. Would look really cool but I
		just cannot be arsed, so there goes.
