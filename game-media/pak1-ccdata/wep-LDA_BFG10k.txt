Designer's note:-
		I'm actually pretty pleased with how
		this one turned out. I didn't have
		high hopes for this at all. The
		downside is that it's quite chunky
		at 650 triangles and no LOD. I'm
		happy with how it behaves and how it
		looks, though. I know I always say
		this but I really did rush this, like
		I've rushed all of my Quake 3 stuff.
		So little love was put into this.
		The skinning of my last two weapons
		are particularly horrible, and as
		you can see with this BFG, very
		little of the skin detail actually
		is seen due to the environment
		effects through the alpha-channel,
		which I usually use to disguise the
		horrible skinning jobs I do. Also,
		with such skinning techniques, it's
		cause for the entire model to use
		more memory, so nothing I've ever
		done has been suited for performance.
		Anyway, nothing else to say except
		that I'm very happy this fat bastard
		is finished with. People will be
		saying that about me one day. Heheh.
